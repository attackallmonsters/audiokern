/**
 * @brief Lightweight thread pool for parallel task execution in DSP systems.
 *
 * This class manages a fixed number of worker threads and allows scheduling
 * arbitrary tasks (`std::function<void()>`) for background processing.
 *
 * It is specifically designed for audio/DSP contexts, where control over
 * task completion (via `wait()`) is important and deterministic lifecycles
 * are preferred over dynamic spawning.
 *
 * Usage:
 * @code
 * DSPThreadPool pool;
 * pool.initialize(cpu_count());  // Start one thread per logical core
 *
 * for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)
 * {
 *     pool.execute([=]() {
 *         do_something_heavy(i);
 *     });
 * }
 *
 * pool.wait(); // Block until all tasks have finished
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note Tasks should be short-lived and non-blocking to avoid deadlocks or starvation.
 * @note This thread pool is not intended for real-time audio threads (e.g. audio callbacks).
